The task is to implement a ranking system based on the PageRank index using the «Amazon US Customer Review» dataset, published on Kaggle under the amazon.com 
conditions of use. The entities to be ranked can be either customers or products. In the first case, there will be a link between two customers if they have reviewed 
at least a same product, while in the second one two products will be linked if they have been reviewed at least by a same customer. Note that this dataset is composed 
by several CSV files, each related to a specific product category: you are free to choose how much such files have to be processed.
